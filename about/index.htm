				<h1>About</h1><br><br>
				 <p>ITS DataHub provides a single point of entry to discover publicly available, reusable, and open ITS research projects and data management tools. ITS DataHub enables free access to research datasets and associated documentation in near-real time and decreases the time from research to insight.</p>
				<p>Users can directly connect and contribute to the ITS DataHub community and open data by hosting new data, generating data stories, creating data visualizations, downloading data, or recommending improvements. ITS DataHub facilitates third-party research into the effectiveness of emerging ITS technologies, preliminary development of third-party applications, and harmonization across similar collections.</p>
				<h2>Available Data</h2>
				<p> A wide variety of datasets created using ITS technologies are discoverable on ITS DataHub. Through ITS DataHub, datasets are all searchable in one central location. ITS DataHub’s datasets contain various types of information including, but not limited to, connected vehicle messages, automated vehicle data, trajectories, field test data, sensor data, connected equipment data, weather data, and application messages. Large, continuously expanding, or immature data is stored in a “sandbox” data environment.</p>
				<br>
